### Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

#### ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-001: Adopt an in-house SQLite DAG engine instead of an existing workflow framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Needed to choose a workflow engine technology stack, considering existing frameworks like Airflow, Prefect, etc., versus a custom-built solution.

## Decision
Adopt a custom, lightweight DAG engine based on SQLite in WAL mode.

## Rationale
1.  **Memory Constraints**: Existing frameworks have a large memory footprint (Airflow > 500MB), whereas the custom solution is ≤ 50MB.
2.  **Deployment Complexity**: Avoids external dependencies, simplifying deployment and maintenance.
3.  **Customization Needs**: The archive scenario has special requirements that need deep customization.
4.  **Performance Requirements**: Requires task scheduling latency ≤ 50ms, which existing frameworks cannot meet.

## Consequences
- **Advantages**: Precise control over memory and performance, simplified deployment.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires in-house development and maintenance, functionality is relatively simple.
- **Mitigation**: Using the mature SQLite technology reduces risks.

## Compliance
Complies with the KISS principle by avoiding unnecessary complexity.
