# Story 1.2: Establish RBAC Access Control

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system maintainer,
**I want** to establish a role-based access control (RBAC) system for the ADG platform,
**so that** different users can access appropriate functions based on their roles while ensuring system security and compliance with enterprise requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User authentication system implemented: Support user login/logout with secure password management using PBKDF2 hashing
2. Role hierarchy established: Implement 4 standard roles (ADMIN, OPERATOR, VIEWER, AUDITOR) with defined permissions
3. Permission system operational: Create granular permission controls for directory operations, workflow management, AI features, and system administration
4. Session management secured: Implement secure session handling with timeout, concurrency limits, and fixation protection
5. Legacy compatibility maintained: Default authorization for single-user scenarios to ensure smooth transition from existing usage patterns
6. API security layer functional: Implement JWT-based authentication with rate limiting and endpoint permission mapping
7. Progressive security enablement: Feature flag system allows gradual rollout of security features without disrupting existing operations
8. Audit logging implemented: All authentication and authorization events logged to tamper-proof audit system with trace ID integration

- **AuditEvent Model**: Security event logging with tamper-proof hash chaining [Source: architecture/06-technical-implementation.md#enhanced-audit-system]

### API Specifications
API security layer requirements from architecture:

- **Endpoint Permissions**: Granular mapping of HTTP methods to required permissions [Source: architecture/02-security-architecture.md#endpoint-permission-mapping]

**API Endpoint Design Details**:
- **Authentication endpoints**: `POST /api/v1/auth/login`, `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`, `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`
- **User management endpoints**: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/users`, `PUT /api/v1/users/{id}/roles`

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure and security architecture:
- Core security management: `utils/security_manager.py` (new)
- JWT token handling: `utils/jwt_manager.py` (new)
- Session management: `utils/session_manager.py` (new)
- RBAC models: `utils/rbac_models.py` (new)

- Legacy compatibility: `utils/legacy_security_wrapper.py` (new)
- Security configuration: `config/security_config.yaml` (new)
- Security constants: `utils/security_constants.py` (new)

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/04-development-standards.md]:
- Unit tests: 85%+ coverage for all security components with special focus on authentication flows
- Integration tests: End-to-end authentication and authorization workflows
- Security tests: Penetration testing for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Performance tests: Authentication latency < 100ms, session validation < 50ms
- Test location: `tests/unit/security/` and `tests/integration/security/`
- Framework: pytest with security-specific fixtures and mocking

**Security-Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Password hashing validation with PBKDF2 standard compliance
- JWT token validation including expiration, signature verification, and key rotation
- Session security testing including timeout, concurrency, and fixation protection
- RBAC permission matrix validation for all roles and operations
- Feature flag security transition testing for legacy compatibility

**Performance Baseline Testing Scenarios**:
- **Load Test 1**: 100 concurrent users authentication (target: <100ms avg response)
- **Load Test 2**: 500 permission checks per second (target: <10ms avg response)
- **Load Test 3**: JWT token generation under load (target: <50ms P95)
- **Stress Test**: Authentication system with 1000 concurrent sessions
- **Memory Test**: Security components memory usage validation (<25MB target)

### Technical Constraints
**Memory Budget Allocation** [Source: architecture/01-core-architecture.md#hardware-resource-budget]:
- Security components: Estimated 25MB allocated from existing Node Engine budget
- JWT key management: In-memory key cache with rotation cleanup
- Session storage: SQLite-based with WAL mode optimization
- Audit logging: Leverages existing SQLite infrastructure

**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/01-core-architecture.md]:
- Authentication latency: < 100ms for user login
- Authorization check: < 10ms for permission validation
- JWT token operations: < 50ms for generation/validation
- Session operations: < 20ms for session validation
- Baseline preservation: Security layer must not degrade existing Excel generation performance

**Security Compliance Standards**:
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements [Source: architecture/02-security-architecture.md#security-configuration-file]
- Session Security: 8-hour timeout, 3 concurrent sessions max, session fixation protection
- JWT Security: RS256 algorithm, 15-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
- Audit Requirements: Tamper-proof logging with 3-year retention minimum

### Project Structure Notes
Security implementation aligns with existing project structure:
- Security utilities in `utils/` directory consistent with existing `feature_manager.py` and `validation_schemas.py`
- Configuration files in project root following `app_config.json` pattern
- Integration with existing node engine through middleware pattern
- Leverages established SQLite infrastructure for session and audit storage

### Legacy Compatibility Strategy
Progressive security enablement approach:
- **Phase 1** (Week 1): Audit logging and input validation (always enabled)
- **Phase 2** (Week 2): Authentication system with legacy bypass mode - enable when 95% of login flows tested
- **Phase 3** (Week 3): Authorization and permission enforcement - enable when all role mappings validated
- **Phase 4** (Week 4): Full API security with rate limiting - enable after performance testing complete
- Feature flags control each phase with automatic rollback capability

**Database Migration Strategy**:
- Create new security tables alongside existing structure
- Implement dual-write pattern for gradual data migration
- Use feature flags to switch from legacy to new authentication
- Maintain backup/restore procedures for rollback scenarios
- Validate data integrity at each migration step

## Testing

**Testing Standards from Architecture**:
- **Test file location**: `tests/unit/security/` for unit tests, `tests/integration/security/` for integration tests
- **Test standards**: pytest framework with security fixtures, 85%+ coverage requirement for security components
- **Testing frameworks**: pytest, pytest-cov for coverage, pytest-mock for mocking, pytest-asyncio for async testing
- **Specific testing requirements**:
  - Authentication flow testing (login/logout/session management)
  - Authorization matrix testing (all role/permission combinations)
  - JWT token lifecycle testing (generation/validation/rotation/revocation)
  - Security vulnerability testing (injection, XSS, CSRF protection)
  - Performance testing (authentication/authorization latency requirements)
  - Legacy compatibility testing (seamless transition validation)
