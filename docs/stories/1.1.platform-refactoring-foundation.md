# Story 1.1: Platform Refactoring Foundation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system maintainer,
**I want** to refactor the ADG tool into an extensible platform with node-based architecture,
**so that** we can support the complete archive digitization process while maintaining 100% compatibility with existing Excel generation functionality.

2. Node engine framework established: Create lightweight DAG-based node execution engine with memory footprint < 50MB
3. Configuration management: Implement feature flag system for progressive migration between legacy and new systems
4. Data flow foundation: Establish standardized node input/output interfaces and data models
5. Basic workflow execution: Support simple linear workflow execution with at least 3 node types (Input, Process, Output)
